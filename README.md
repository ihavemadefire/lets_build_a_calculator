## Open source project for newer developers

**Let's Build a Calculator** is an open-source project that allows newer developers to contribute to a collaborative project. The challenges will be distributed as git issues on the repo, so *don't forget to star the repo* to watch the project as it grows. The challenges will vary in skill set and can be in any part of the repo.

A note for true newbies: Welcome! We want you here. We want other impassioned software geeks in the world. So, don't be afraid to ask questions or for some help. This is a positive place to build your chops. The only person not welcome here is you impostor syndrome!

A corollary to that is: Be nice! If you have more expertise than someone and can help, that's practice as well. If someone asks a day zero question, and it seems obvious to you, remember it wasn't always that obvious. Share the wisdom you have in the most constructive way possible and you're already on your way to being a mentor. Learning to be a patient coach is the fist step to being the kind of manager you would want to work for.

## Contributing, A How-To guide

Let's say you found an issue that you can handle and hasn't been worked on yet. There is a well established workflow for contributing to open source projects

### Steps
1. Fork the repo (You already starred it right?)
2. Clone the repo
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Make your changes
5. Add your name/github handle to the contributers.md file
6. Commit/push your changes
7. Create a pull request
8. If it looks good it will be merged into the master. If it needs revision, I (or whoever is doing the review) provide some helpful notes on how to get the code just right.

## General Rules
- Feel free to jump in on an issue. But the first PR that's merged will be there until another issue is submitted to correct it.
- Only submit a PR every once in a while. If you see an issue has been unresolved for 4-5 days, then go ahead. The point is to let others get a shot. Newcomers will always get priority.
- After 4 successful approved PRs, you level up into submitting issues for enhancements, new testing, code refoctoring, even improving this documention.
